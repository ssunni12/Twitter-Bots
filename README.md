# Twitter-Bots
Two simple Twitter bots, made in Python.

The first, "Follower Bot," checks my bot's followers every 5 minutes. It goes through that list, and follows every user that isn't already being followed.

The second, "Like And Retweet Bot," searches through Twitter for Tweets matching certain keywords (in this case, my first name, my last name, and the word "Python").
If a match is found, my bot likes and retweets that tweet. However, the bot avoids doing so to Tweets that are only replies to other Tweets, or Tweets that come from the bot itself.
